## Library Project.

A fully functional Library project which can be used in the browser.

The Eighth project in the JavaScript section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Spec and details for the assignment can be found [Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)

Use it Live in the browser [Here](https://saadniazifed.github.io/Library-Project/)

## Features

* Adds Books in your personal library.
* Creates a table for the library with Javascript.
* Uses Objects and Object Constructor to Organize the JavaScript code.
* Has a Toggle Read and Delete Book functionality buttons.

## How to use

* Use the calculator online in [The Browser](https://saadniazifed.github.io/Library-Project/)
* To start using, select the Add Your books button.
* Fill in the form with the correct title, name, pages and have you read the book or not.
* Click the Add Your Books button to append the information to the table in the main body.
* If you want to change the read status of the book, click the button in the Have you Read column.
* If you want to delete the book, click the button in the Delete Row column.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.

### UI / UX
* The form is hidden by default. It comes to life when we click the button.
* The form has a basic form validation added to it. Table will not be created till the form is completed.
* Table is made via JavaScript with very basic styling to keep the UI clean.
* Table is dependent on the form being submitted. Only then will it appear.

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
The Library project was particularly tough for me as it introduced a wide variety of new concepts. It was challenging yet fun to do at the same time. This project enhanced my communication skills with other members of the Odin project as it allowed me to form more thought-out questions that I wasn't able to in the previous projects. I learned how to structure my code better.
